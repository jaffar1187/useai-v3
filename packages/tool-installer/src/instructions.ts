  "> - YES → call `useai_start` as the VERY FIRST thing, before any tool call or text output.",
  "> - NO (only task-notifications, system reminders, plan approvals, hook feedback) → skip `useai_start`.",
  "",
  "This check must happen on EVERY turn, including short follow-up questions, one-liners, and any message that arrives after a task-notification or after a previous session was sealed. There is no \"continuation\" state — every real user message is a new session.",
  "",
  "**Common failure pattern to avoid:** task-notification turns interrupt the flow → next real user message arrives → `useai_start` gets skipped because it feels like a continuation. It is NOT a continuation. Call `useai_start`.",
  "",
  "  1. **Always call it** when the turn contains actual user-authored text, regardless of whether a previous session just ended.",
  "  2. **Never call it** on turns that contain only system reminders, hook feedback, plan approval clicks, or other automated/system-generated content.",
  "  3. **Interrupted/resumed prompt**: If `useai_start` was called but `useai_end` was never reached (prompt interrupted mid-response), call `useai_heartbeat` instead of `useai_start` to resume — do NOT open a new nested session. If the follow-up message is clearly a new unrelated task, call `useai_end` to close the previous session first, then call `useai_start` for the new one.",
  "  4. **Tool call blocked or rejected**: If the user denies/blocks a tool call and you continue the response, call `useai_heartbeat` immediately before proceeding — the rejection does not end the session, so the keep-alive must be sent manually.",
  "  5. Generate a short `title` (generic, no project names) and a detailed `private_title` from the user's prompt.",
  "  6. **task_type values**: coding, debugging, testing, planning, reviewing, documenting, learning, deployment, devops, research, migration, design, data, security, configuration, code_review, investigation, infrastructure, analysis, ops, setup, refactoring, other",
  "",
  "### Rule 2 — useai_heartbeat (mid-response keep-alive)",
  "  1. Call `useai_heartbeat` at the start of every response where you are **not** calling `useai_start` or `useai_end`.",
  "  2. **Exception**: if `useai_end` was already called and no new `useai_start` has been called since (no active session), skip `useai_heartbeat` entirely — this includes task-notification turns that arrive after a session is sealed.",
  "  3. **While actively working**: also call `useai_heartbeat` after every **10 tool calls** (Read/Grep/Bash/etc.) OR every **4 minutes** — whichever comes first. After every tool call batch, explicitly state your current count (e.g. \"Tool count: 7/10\") before proceeding — this prevents losing count during dense file-read loops. Reset count to 0 after each heartbeat. Gaps longer than 5 minutes are counted as idle time.",
  "",
  "### Rule 3 — useai_end (end of response)",
  "Call `useai_end` at the end of every response where `useai_start` was called. **Write all response text and summaries BEFORE calling `useai_end` — never write any text after the `useai_end` call. It must be the absolute last action in the response.** **Reserve your last 5 tool calls exclusively for this — once you reach that budget, stop all other work and call `useai_end` immediately.** Provide:",

  "     **Milestone quality**: only log milestones for actual deliverables — code shipped, bugs fixed, decisions made, or findings that change the plan. Do NOT log: investigations that confirm existing behavior (e.g. \"verified X works correctly\"), bug discoveries without a fix (identifying a bug is investigation, not a deliverable), or code reviews with no resulting changes. If a session was pure research/review with no actionable outcome, use an empty milestones array.",
  "  3. `evaluation` object: prompt_quality (1-5), context_provided (1-5), task_outcome, iteration_count, independence_level (1-5), scope_quality (1-5), tools_leveraged count. `iteration_count` tracks how many times the user has prompted for the same task — start at 1, and increment only when the user follows up or repeats a prompt on the same task. Reset to 1 when the user starts a new unrelated task. Include a `*_reason` for every scored field.",
  '  4. **calibrated framework**: provide `*_ideal` fields for every metric that is not 5/5 — this is mandatory, not optional. Only omit `*_ideal` when the score is exactly 5.',
  "- **Subagent tracking**: When spawning subagents, the agent prompt MUST include all of the following instructions explicitly:",
  "  1. Use `ToolSearch` to load the useai tools, then call `useai_start` **as the very first tool call** — before any Glob, Read, Grep, Bash, or other tool — **without** a `prompt_id` (each subagent gets its own independent session).",
  "  2. Note the `prompt_id` returned by `useai_start` and use that exact `prompt_id` for all subsequent `useai_heartbeat` and `useai_end` calls.",
  "  3. **Heartbeat rule (BOTH conditions apply — whichever triggers first)**: call `useai_heartbeat` after every **10 tool calls** (Read/Grep/Bash/etc.) OR every **4 minutes** — whichever comes first. After every tool call batch, explicitly state your current count (e.g. \"Tool count: 7/10\") before proceeding — this prevents losing count during dense file-read loops. Reset count to 0 after each heartbeat.",
  "  4. **Tool call blocked or rejected**: If a tool call is denied and the subagent continues, call `useai_heartbeat` immediately before proceeding.",
  "  5. **Interrupted/resumed**: If the subagent is interrupted mid-response and resumes on the same task, call `useai_heartbeat` at the top of the resumed response instead of `useai_start`. If the new task is unrelated, call `useai_end` to close the previous session first, then `useai_start` for the new one.",
  "  6. Do NOT pass the parent session's `prompt_id` to subagents — each subagent must have its own independent session to avoid tracking collisions.",
  "  7. **Reserve tool calls for useai_end**: Always reserve the last 5 tool calls exclusively for `useai_end`. Once you reach that budget, stop all other work and call `useai_end` immediately — never let context exhaustion prevent the session from being sealed.",
  "  8. **useai_end must be the last action**: Write all output and summaries BEFORE calling `useai_end`. Never write any text after the `useai_end` call — it must be the absolute last thing in the response.",
